% general
deltat = 1e-4; % what is the time step of the data?

% debug preferences

% display preferences
marker_size = 5; 			% how big the spike indicators are
show_r2 = false;			% show r2 in firing rate plot

% firing rate estimation

show_firing_rate_r2 = false; 	% show r-square of firing rates?

% UI

% spike resolution
