Spike sorting for Kontroller

`spikesort` can read data generated by [Kontroller](https://github.com/sg-s/kontroller) and help you sort spikes from multiple neurons in a single extracellular voltage recording. This was developed for sorting the action potentials of Drosophila Olfactory Receptor Neurons, but would probably work in other contexts.
