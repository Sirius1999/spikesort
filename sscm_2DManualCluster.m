% sscm_2DManualCluster.m
% allows you to manually cluster a reduced-to-2D-dataset by drawling lines around clusters
% usage:
% C = sscm_ManualCluster(R);
%
% where R C a 2xN matrix
% 
% this is derived from ManualCluster.m, but renamed for plugin-compatibility for spikesort

% largely built out of legacy code I wrote in 2011 for Carlotta's spike sorting
function [A,B,N] = sscm_2DManualCluster(R,V_snippets,loc)

idx = manualCluster(R,V_snippets,{'A neuron','B neuron','Noise','Doublet','Coincident Spikes'});

A = loc(idx==1);
B = loc(idx==2);
N = loc(idx==3);

% handle coincident spikes
A = unique([A loc(idx==5)]);
B = unique([B loc(idx==5)]);


% handle doublets
